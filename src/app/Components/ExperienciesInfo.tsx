        I was an internship student at the university, my position consisted of
        developing a new interface on the university page using technologies
        such as Javascript, HTML, CSS and Joomla!5. In this project I worked
        closely with my colleagues using scrum agile methodology, in such a way
        that it facilitated planning, progress and adaptation to changes in the
        project efficiently.
